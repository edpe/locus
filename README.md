# locus



Locus is a generative music project that uses the Tone.js WebAudio framework, React and Lerna to create a series of sevice agents that make artificially generated music.

The agents themselves will be effected by their environment (using location based APIs and device sensors) and generate material accordingly.

```
npm install
cd ./packages/locus-app
npm start
```
